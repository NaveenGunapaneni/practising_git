- ✅ File management table with search and filtering
- ✅ Sortable columns (upload date, filename, engagement name)
- ✅ Status indicators (processed/pending)
- ✅ Download functionality for processed files

### 3. **File Upload System**
- ✅ Drag-and-drop file upload interface
- ✅ File type validation (XLSX, CSV only)
- ✅ File size validation (50MB limit)
- ✅ Progress tracking during upload
- ✅ Form validation for required fields (engagement name, dates)

- ✅ Smooth transitions and animations

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Tech Stack**
- **React 18** with hooks and functional components
- **React Router** for client-side routing
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Axios** for API communication
- **React Dropzone** for file uploads
- **React Hot Toast** for notifications
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **Date-fns** for date manipulation

### **API Integration**
The UI integrates seamlessly with all GeoPulse API endpoints:

- **POST** `/api/v1/auth/register` - User registration
- **POST** `/api/v1/auth/login` - User authentication
- **GET** `/api/v1/dashboard` - Dashboard data with query parameters
- **POST** `/api/v1/files/upload` - File upload with multipart/form-data
- **GET** `/api/v1/files/{id}/download` - File download

### **State Management**
- **AuthContext** for authentication state
- **Local storage** for token persistence
- **React hooks** for component state management

### **Error Handling**
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Network error detection
- Validation error display
- Automatic logout on authentication failures

## 🎯 User Flow

1. **Registration** → Users create account with organization details
2. **Login** → Secure authentication with JWT tokens
3. **Dashboard** → View metrics and previously processed files
4. **File Upload** → Upload XLSX/CSV files with engagement details
5. **Processing** → Files are automatically processed on the server
6. **Download** → Download processed files from the dashboard
