# Project Requirements

This folder contains all the requirement documents for the UI design project.

## Structure
- Upload your requirement README files here
- Each file should contain specific requirements for different aspects of the project
- Files will be organized and referenced during the design process

## Instructions
1. Upload all your requirement README files to this folder
2. Name them descriptively (e.g., `user-interface-requirements.md`, `design-system-requirements.md`, etc.)
